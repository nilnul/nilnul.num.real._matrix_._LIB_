	/// <summary>
	/// In mathematics, and in particular linear algebra, a skew-symmetric (or antisymmetric or antimetric[1]) matrix is a square matrix A whose transpose is also its negative; that is, it satisfies the equation A = −AT. If the entry in the i th row and j th column is aij, i.e. A = (aij) then the skew symmetric condition is aij = −aji.
